A simple streamlit app utilizing a Text classification BERT model from flair package.
It is embedded in a streamlit app and is able to analyze the sentiment of a given text.

Sentiment can be either Positive, Negative or Neutral.

Docker commands (in 'aufgabe4_khoss' folder):
docker compose build
docker compose up

The docker repo is automatically updated on evry push using github actions.
For more informations, see .github/workflows/main.yml

Note:
Unfortunately, the image is 7GB big and therefore quite heavy.
I was not able to reduce the size significantly.
- Also, the model is well over 200mb big, therefore it is uploaded using `git lfs`. Please be mindful of that.
